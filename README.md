## Achievements of the Revised Driver

The modifications to the Pimoroni HUB75 driver result in the following improvements:

- **Offloading Work**: Moves processing from the CPU to DMA and PIO co-processors.
- **Performance Boost**: Implements self-paced, interlinked DMA and PIO processes.
- **Eliminates Synchronization Delays**: No need for `hub75_wait_tx_stall`, removing blocking synchronization.
- **Optimized Interrupt Handling**: Reduces code complexity in the interrupt handler.

These enhancements lead to significant performance improvements. In tests up to a **250 MHz system clock**, no ghost images were observed.

---

## Motivation

As part of a private project, I sought to gain deeper knowledge of the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. I highly recommend **[Raspberry Pi Pico Lectures 2022 by Hunter Adams](https://youtu.be/CAMTBzPd-WI?feature=shared)**—they provide excellent insights!

If you are specifically interested in **PIO (Programmable Input/Output)**, start with [Lecture 14: Introducing PIO](https://youtu.be/BVdaw56Ln8s?feature=shared) and [Lecture 15: PIO Overview and Examples](https://youtu.be/wet9CYpKZOQ).

Inspired by Adams' discussion on **[DMA](https://youtu.be/TGjUHChO1kM?feature=shared&t=1475) and PIO co-processors**, I optimized the HUB75 driver as a self-assigned challenge.

😊 **[Raspberry Pi Pico Lectures 2025 by Hunter Adams](https://youtu.be/a4uLrfqHZQU?feature=shared")** is available now!

## Evolution of Pico HUB75 Drivers

### Raspberry Pi Pico HUB75 Example

The **Pico HUB75 example** demonstrates connecting an **HUB75 LED matrix panel** using PIO. This educational example prioritizes clarity and ease of understanding.

- The color palette is generated by modulating the **Output Enable (OE)** signal.
- **Binary Coded Modulation (BCM)** is applied row-by-row, modulating all color bits before advancing to the next row.
- Synchronization depends on `hub75_wait_tx_stall`.
- **No DMA is used**, leading to lower performance.

### Pimoroni HUB75 Driver

The **Pimoroni HUB75 driver** improves performance by:

- Switching from **row-wise** to **plane-wise** modulation handling.
- Using **DMA** to transfer pixel data to the PIO state machine.
- Still relying on `hub75_wait_tx_stall` for synchronization.

![hub_pimoroni](assets/pimoroni_dma.png)

*Picture 1: Pimoroni's Hub75 Driver DMA Section*

---

## Eliminating `hub75_wait_tx_stall`

Both the **Raspberry Pi and Pimoroni** implementations use `hub75_wait_tx_stall`, which ensures:

- The state machine **stalls** on an empty TX FIFO.
- The system **waits** until the OEn pulse has finished.

However, this blocking method **prevents an efficient DMA-based approach**.

### Original `hub75_wait_tx_stall` Implementation

```c
static inline void hub75_wait_tx_stall(PIO pio, uint sm) {
    uint32_t txstall_mask = 1u << (PIO_FDEBUG_TXSTALL_LSB + sm);
    pio->fdebug = txstall_mask;
    while (!(pio->fdebug & txstall_mask)) {
        tight_loop_contents();
    }
}
```

### Alternative Approach

Instead of waiting for TX FIFO stalling, we can:

1. Modify the **PIO program** to emit a signal once the OEn pulse completes.
2. Set up a **DMA channel** to listen for this signal.
3. Establish an **interrupt handler** to trigger once the signal is received.

This approach allows fully **chained DMA execution** without CPU intervention.

## DMA Chains and PIO State Machines in the Revised HUB75 Driver

### Overview

The following diagram illustrates the interactions between **DMA channels** and **PIO state machines**:

```
[ Pixel Data DMA ] -> [ hub75_data_rgb888 PIO ]
       |
       |--> [ Dummy Pixel Data DMA ] -> [ hub75_data_rgb888 PIO ]
                  |
                  |--> [ OEn Data DMA ] -> [ hub75_row PIO ]
                           |
                           |--> [ OEn Finished DMA ] (Triggers interrupt)
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Pixel Data Transfer**
   - Pixel data is streamed via **DMA** to the **hub75_rdata_gb888** PIO state machine.
   - This handles shifting pixel data into the LED matrix.

2. **Dummy Pixel Handling**
   - A secondary **dummy pixel DMA channel** adds additional pixel data.
   - This ensures correct clocking of the final piece of genuine data.

3. **OEn Pulse Generation**
   - The **OEn data DMA channel** sends 32-bit words - 5 bit address information (row select) and 27 bit puls width - to the **hub75_row** PIO state machine.
   - This output enable signal switches on those LEDs in the current row with bit set in the current bitplane for the specified number of cycles.

4. **Interrupt-Driven Synchronization**
   - A final **OEn finished DMA channel** listens for the end of the pulse.
   - An **interrupt handler** (`oen_finished_handler`) resets DMA for the next cycle.

### Refresh Rate Performance

With a **bit-depth of 10**, the HUB75 driver achieves the following refresh rates for a 64 x 64 matrix depending on the system clock:

| System Clock | Refresh Rate |
|--------------|---------------|
| 100 MHz      | 179 Hz        |
| 150 MHz      | 268 Hz        |
| 200 MHz      | 358 Hz        |
| 250 MHz      | 448 Hz        |

These results demonstrate stable operation and high-performance display rendering across a wide range of system clocks.

### Key Benefits of this Approach

✅ Fully **automated** data transfer using **chained DMA channels**.

✅ Eliminates **CPU-intensive** busy-waiting (`hub75_wait_tx_stall`).

✅ Ensures **precise timing** without unnecessary stalling.

---

## Conclusion for DMA and PIO based Approach

By offloading tasks to **DMA and PIO**, the revised HUB75 driver achieves **higher performance**, **simpler interrupt handling**, and **better synchronization**. This approach significantly reduces CPU overhead while eliminating artifacts like **ghosting** at high clock speeds.

If you're interested in optimizing **RGB matrix panel drivers**, this implementation serves as a valuable reference for efficient DMA-based rendering.

---

## Improved Colour Perception

The graphics system for the demo effects operates in **RGB888** format (8 bits per channel, 24 bits per pixel). To better match human vision, colours are mapped using the [CIE 1931 lightness curve](https://jared.geek.nz/2013/02/linear-led-pwm/). This mapping effectively expands the usable range to **10 bits per channel**.

The HUB75 driver takes advantage of this: its PIO/DMA pipeline packs each pixel as a **32-bit word** with 10 bits for red, 10 bits for green, and 10 bits for blue.

---

### Increased Perceptual Colour Depth (Temporal Dithering)

To go beyond native 10-bit precision without changing the data format, the driver employs  **temporal dithering** (an accumulator-based technique):

- Each pixel maintains a high-precision accumulator (e.g. 16 bits).  
- On every refresh, the top 10 bits are sent to the panel, while the lower bits remain stored.  
- Over successive frames, these residuals accumulate, averaging out to produce smoother gradients.  

This results in a perceived colour depth equivalent to **12–14 bits per channel**.

### ✅ Advantages

- Noticeable improvement in gradients and subtle colour transitions.  
- Minimal CPU overhead (shifts and adds only).  

### ⚠️ Trade-offs

- Requires additional RAM for accumulators.  
  For a 64×64 panel: `64 × 64 × 3 × sizeof(uint32_t) ≈ 48 KB`.

## Brightness Control

In addition to bitplane modulation, the driver supports **software-based brightness regulation**. This allows easy adjustment of overall panel brightness without hardware changes.

### API Functions

```cpp
// Set the baseline brightness scaling factor (default = 6, range 1–255).
// Larger values increase brightness but also raise OEn frequency.
void setBasisBrightness(uint8_t factor);

// Set fine-grained brightness intensity as a fraction [0.0 – 1.0].
void setIntensity(float intensity);
```

### How it Works

- <code>setBasisBrightness(basis)</code>

  Defines the top brightness.

  Example: <code>setBasisBrightness(6)</code> → default brightness range for typical 64×64 panels. \
  Larger factors give more headroom for brightness but consume more **Binary Coded Modulation (BCM)** time slices.

- <code>setIntensity(intensity)</code>
  
  Fine-grained adjustment from 0.0 (dark/off) to 1.0 (full brightness).\
  This function scales the effective duty cycle within the current baseline brightness range.

```cpp
// Example: brighten the panel, then dim at runtime
setBasisBrightness(8); // Start with baseline factor 8 for a brighter panel
setIntensity(0.5f);    // Show at 50% of that baseline
```

### Default Settings

- <code>basis_factor = 6u</code>
- <code>intensity = 1.0f</code>
  (full brightness within the baseline)

This corresponds to the same brightness as earlier driver revisions without adjustment.

### Practical Notes

- Increasing the basis factor may increase peak current consumption.
- For indoor use, values between 4–8 are usually sufficient.
- For dimmer environments, you can keep the baseline factor low (e.g. 4) and rely on setIntensity() for smooth runtime control.
- Both functions are non-blocking and can be called during normal operation.

## Demo Effects

⚠️ The examples contained in hub75_lvgl.cpp have been tested with a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 microcontroller (RP2350). For a RP2040 processor you might have to comment out some demo effects due to minor memory capabilities. Ask if you need support 🙂.

# Prerequisites for the Hub75 Driver

This driver is designed for a **64×64 LED matrix panel**. It can be adapted for **64×32, 32×32**, or other HUB75-compatible panels.

The PIO implementation requires that **data pins (colours)** and **row-select pins** must be in **consecutive GPIO blocks**.

The default implementation looks like this (see hub75.cpp). An example of a valid alternative pin defintion is shown in [Allowed Deviations](#allowed_deviations_anchor)

   ```cpp
   // Default wiring of HUB75 matrix to RP2350
   #define DATA_BASE_PIN    0   // first color data pin
   #define DATA_N_PINS      6   // number of color data pins (R0,G0,B0,R1,G1,B1)
   #define ROWSEL_BASE_PIN  6   // first row-select (address) pin
   #define ROWSEL_N_PINS    5   // number of row-select pins (A0–A4)
   #define CLK_PIN          11  // clock
   #define STROBE_PIN       12  // latch (LAT)
   #define OEN_PIN          13  // output enable (OE)
   ```

## Wiring Details

### Colour Data Pins

- `DATA_BASE_PIN` = **GPIO 0** (first in a consecutive block)
- `DATA_N_PINS` = **6** (for R0, G0, B0, R1, G1, B1)

| Hub75 Colour Bit   | connected to      | Pico GPIO |
|:-------------------|-------------------|:-----:|
| R0                 |                   | 0    |
| G0                 |                   | 1    |
| B0                 |                   | 2    |
| R1                 |                   | 3    |

### Address (Row Select) Pins

- `ROWSEL_BASE_PIN` = **GPIO 6**
- `ROWSEL_N_PINS` = **5** (A0–A4)

- **Consecutiveness is required** by the PIO program.

| Address bit |  connected to      | Pico GPIO |
| ----------- |--------------------|:---------:|
| A0          |                    | 6    |
| A1          |                    | 7    |
| A2          |                    | 8    |
| A3          |                    | 9    |
| A4          |                    | 10   |

### Control Pins

- **LAT** (strobe/latch): GPIO 12
- **OE** (output enable): GPIO 13

### One Glance Mapping HUB75 Connector → Pico GPIOs

The diagram shows the default mapping as defined in the hub75.cpp file.
  
<img src="assets/pico_wiring.png">

## Allowed Deviations  <a id='allowed_deviations_anchor'></a>

The **only strict requirement** is that **data pins** and **row-select pins** must be in **consecutive GPIO blocks**.
Clock, Latch, and OE pins may be freely chosen.

### Example: Custom Pin Mapping

```cpp
#define ROWSEL_BASE_PIN  15  // Row select pins moved to GPIO 15–19
#define ROWSEL_N_PINS    5   // number of row-select pins (A0–A4)

#define DATA_BASE_PIN    3   // Color data pins starting at GPIO 3
#define DATA_N_PINS      6   // number of color data pins (R0,G0,B0,R1,G1,B1)

// Control pins assigned to arbitrarily GPIO pins
#define CLK_PIN          0
#define STROBE_PIN       1
#define OEN_PIN          2
```

## How to Use a 64×32 HUB75 Matrix Panel

The Hub75 driver is designed for 64×64 panels, but it also supports **64×32 panels** (half the height) and other panel dimensions e.g. **128x64**.  
The electrical connections for 64x32 panels are nearly identical to 64x64 panels — the difference lies in how rows are addressed and how the frame buffer is filled.

### Wiring

In file `hub75_driver.cpp` use the same pin definitions as for a 64×64 panel, **except** for the `ROWSEL_N_PINS` definition which must be changed to `4` (A0–A3). Address line **A4 is not connected**.

   ```cpp
   // Default wiring of HUB75 matrix to RP2350
   #define DATA_BASE_PIN    0   // first color data pin
   #define DATA_N_PINS      6   // number of color data pins (R0,G0,B0,R1,G1,B1)
   #define ROWSEL_BASE_PIN  6   // first row-select (address) pin
   #define ROWSEL_N_PINS    4   // number of row-select pins (A0–A3)
   #define CLK_PIN          11  // clock
   #define STROBE_PIN       12  // latch (LAT)
   #define OEN_PIN          13  // output enable (OE)
   ```

### Initialization of Matrix Panel Dimension

At the top of file `hub75_driver.cpp` set the `MATRIX_PANEL_HEIGHT` to the height of the panel (32 in this example).

   ```cpp
   #define MATRIX_PANEL_WIDTH 64
   #define MATRIX_PANEL_HEIGHT 32
   #define OFFSET MATRIX_PANEL_WIDTH *(MATRIX_PANEL_HEIGHT >> 1)
   ```

### Frame Buffer Layout

- A 64×32 panel uses half the memory of a 64×64 panel.
- Each refresh cycle addresses 16 row pairs (instead of 32).
- The driver automatically adjusts its addressing logic based on the height you specify.

### Practical Notes

Not all of the demo effects will show correctly for a 64x32 matrix panel. The first two demo effects use image data for a 64x64 layout. You will see some output, but it will look weird.

The `bouncing balls` effect will not show the complete text as the position is hard coded. The `fire_effect` and the `rotator`might look as they should be.

Have fun with adapting the source code or with implementing your own effects.

Do not hesitate to contact me - I will gladly answer your questions!

## Scan Rate Support

### Multiplexing Modes (Rows Lit Simultaneously)

Many HUB75 panel datasheets describe the **scan rate** using terms like *1:16* or *1:32*.  
This can be confusing, because the actual driver behavior is about **how many rows are lit simultaneously**.

To make things explicit, this driver uses **multiplexing defines**:

| Multiplexing Mode         | Rows Lit at Once | Typical Datasheet Scan Rate | Example Panels               |
|----------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| `#define HUB75_MULTIPLEX_2_ROWS` | 2 rows          | 1:32                        | 64×64 (1:32), 64×32 (1:16)   |
| `#define HUB75_MULTIPLEX_4_ROWS` | 4 rows          | 1:16 or 1:8                 | 64×64 (1:16), 64×32 (1:8)    |

### Example: 64×64 panel, 1:32 scan

- Datasheet says **1:32** (one out of 32 row groups active at a time).  
- This means **2 rows lit simultaneously**.  
- In code, use:

  ```c
  #define HUB75_MULTIPLEX_2_ROWS
  ```

### How to Configure

In your build, define the scan rate that matches your panel:

```cpp
// Example for 64×64 panels (1/32 scan) - two rows lit simultaneously
#define HUB75_MULTIPLEX_2_ROWS
// Set the number of address lines - 2 rows lit simultaneously leaves 32 rows to be adressed via row select.
// That is 32 = 2 to the power of 5 - we need 5 row select pins  
#define ROWSEL_N_PINS 5

// Example for 64×32 panels (1/8 scan) - four rows lit simultaneously
#define HUB75_MULTIPLEX_4_ROWS
// Set the number of address lines - 4 rows lit simultaneously leaves 8 rows to be adressed via row select.
// That is 8 = 2 to the power of 3 - we need 3 row select pins  
#define ROWSEL_N_PINS 3
```
